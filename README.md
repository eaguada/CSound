# Project Description

This is a platform that will ultimately allow new/upcoming and established electronic music producers
to sell their unlicensed / unsigned single tracks & EP's for a fixed price.

You can either sell or offer your tracks for free in which case the "buyer" would have to either follow you on social media,
comment / provide feedback / rate your release in order to get the download link for the full lossless audio file.
